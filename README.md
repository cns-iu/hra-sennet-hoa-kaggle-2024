## Abstract
Efficient algorithms are needed to segment vasculature in new three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging datasets at scale for a wide range of research and clinical applications. Manual segmentation of vessels in images is time-consuming and expensive. Computational approaches are more scalable but have limitations in accuracy. We organized a global machine learning competition, engaging 1,401 participants, to help develop new deep learning methods for 3D blood vessel segmentation. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the top-performing solutions using manually curated 3D Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography datasets of the human kidney, focussing on the segmentation accuracy and morphological analysis, thereby establishing a benchmark for future studies in blood vessel segmentation within phase-contrast tomography imaging.
